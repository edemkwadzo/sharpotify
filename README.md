sharpotify
==========

Sharpotify is a Spotify library written in C#. It is based in Jotify and SharPot projects. It is not a libspotify wrapper, but rather a full .NET Spotify protocol implementation.

Disclaimer:
I did not write the original Sharpotify library. The original which this code is based on can be located here: http://sharpotify.codeplex.com/
